# RollingStone
This is a somewhat simple program that utilizes the SQLite3 library to call a database to provide values upon the user's request. Currently, the database contains information on the albums contained in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (the 2012 version, because the 2020 version makes me vomit).
